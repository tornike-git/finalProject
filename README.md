CookBook

Introduction
This application helps custumers get recipes two ways. One way is to get random recipe by pressing a button and
other option is to type in key ingredients and get recipe accordingly. Since cooking is big part of our everyday lives,
we think this application will make an everyday chore a little bit more fun and comfortable.
