Ingredients
2 large eggs
2 cups 250ml milk (skim, low fat or full fat)
2 1/4 cups white self raising flour
Directions
Whisk the eggs and milk together to combine. Add in the flour, and beat until the batter is smooth and lump free. Add in any option add-ins you like here.
Heat a nonstick pan over low-medium heat with cooking oil spray. Wipe over excess; pour about 1/3 cup of batter per pancake. Cook pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden brown. Flip and cook until golden; transfer to a warmed plate; repeat with remaining batter (spraying/greasing pan between ever second or third pancake if needed).
Serve immediately with yoghurt, ice cream, whipped cream, maple syrup, berries, or any other toppings you like
